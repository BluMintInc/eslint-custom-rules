# Commits
**We use Angular Commit Message Conventions to write our commit messages**. This is very important as incorrectly structured commit messages will not trigger semantic-release properly.
Examples:
fix(pencil): stop graphite breaking when too much pressure applied
feat(pencil): add 'graphiteWidth' option
perf(pencil): remove graphiteWidth option
