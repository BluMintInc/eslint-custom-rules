# Prefer using cloneDeep over nested spread copying (`@blumintinc/blumint/prefer-clone-deep`)

💼 This rule is enabled in the ✅ `recommended` config.

🔧 This rule is automatically fixable by the [`--fix` CLI option](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/user-guide/command-line-interface#--fix).

<!-- end auto-generated rule header -->

Enforces the use of `cloneDeep` from `functions/src/util/cloneDeep.ts` when performing deep object copies instead of using nested spread syntax (`...obj`).

## Rule Details

The spread operator is error-prone when copying deeply nested objects, as it only performs shallow copies, leading to unintended mutations and increased complexity. Using `cloneDeep` ensures a true deep copy while also correctly inferring types, preventing unnecessary type casting and reducing cognitive load.

### ❌ Incorrect

```ts
const result = {
  ...baseObj,
  data: {
    ...baseObj.data,
    nested: {
      ...baseObj.data.nested,
      value: 42
    }
  }
};

const membership = {
  sender: 'unchanged',
  receiver: 'unchanged',
  membership: {
    ...membershipIncomplete,
    sender: {
      ...membershipIncomplete.sender,
      request: {
        ...membershipIncomplete.sender.request,
        status: 'accepted',
      },
    },
    receiver: {
      ...membershipIncomplete.receiver,
      request: {
        ...membershipIncomplete.receiver.request,
        status: 'accepted',
      },
    },
  },
};
```

### ✅ Correct

```ts
const result = cloneDeep(baseObj, {
  data: {
    nested: {
      value: 42
    }
  }
} as const);

const membership = {
  sender: 'unchanged',
  receiver: 'unchanged',
  membership: cloneDeep(membershipIncomplete, {
    sender: {
      request: {
        status: 'accepted',
      },
    },
    receiver: {
      request: {
        status: 'accepted',
      },
    },
  } as const),
};
```

## When Not To Use It

- When dealing with objects that contain functions or symbols, as `cloneDeep` does not support cloning these types
- When only performing shallow copies (single level spread)
- When you need specific control over which properties are deeply vs. shallowly copied

## Version

This rule was introduced in v1.0.0
